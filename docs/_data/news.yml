  title: Website refresh
  text: Continuing with the refactor, the site is now fully vector-based,
    sources have been cleaned up and further minimised, the look refreshed.
    The crew page and code examples are now automatically generated, thus
    much easier to update. Several pages have been converted to Markdown.
    Source size is now 64 kB (was 624 kB). Also added en edit button to
    each page.

  title: Website refactor
  text: Website refactored to use Jekyll, use pure HTML5, drop table based
    layout, drop JavaScript for a CSS menu, remove anything unused, fix things
    broken, use vector images instead of bitmaps where possible, deduplicate
    markup and content. This means 7.5x size reduction of page sources.<br>
    Content and design remained the same, but much easier to update now.

  title: Mailing list address changes
  text: Thanking Phil Barnett for providing the Harbour community a great
    mailing list for so many years, today, due to server problems, we have
    migrated the mailing lists to Google Groups in agreement with Phil and
    Harbour admins.<br>
    Make sure to revise your subscription settings, because digest, nomail
    options and readable name were lost along the migration.
