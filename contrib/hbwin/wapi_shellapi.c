/*
   Function wapi_ShellExecuteEx( aShExecInfoStruct )
   Performs operation(s) on a specified file.
   Usage: nResult := wapi_ShellExecuteEx( {[<hparentWindow>] [, <"operation">] , <"filename"> ;
                                          [, <"parameters">] [, <"workdir">] [, <nShowmode>] ;
                                          [, <nfMask>]} )
   commonly used verbs: "open", "print", "edit", "explore", "find", "properties", "openas" et.c.
                        (The set of available verbs depends on the particular file or folder.
                        Generally, the actions available from an object's shortcut menu are (on paper ;-))
                        available verbs.)
                        - "openas" may not work on older win vers
                        - to get "properties", nfMask must be passed with SEE_MASK_INVOKEIDLIST (0x0000000C) value
   Returns: numeric: > 32 on sucess; <= 32 on failure!
